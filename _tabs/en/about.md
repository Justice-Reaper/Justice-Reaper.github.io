Let me introduce myself, I'm Sergio, I'm 23 years old, and I've always been passionate about computers. However, it wasn't until three years ago that I decided to pursue this field professionally. To get started, I completed a Higher Degree in Multiplatform Application Development (MAD), where I built desktop applications with Java and mobile apps with Kotlin

Later, I leaned toward offensive cybersecurity because I find it the most exciting. I created a personal blog where I share writeups and articles about Portswigger labs and HackTheBox machines. Currently, I have over 290 published articles and post regularly as I prepare for the OSCP and BSCP certifications

Throughout my journey in this field, I've encountered tasks I found tedious or repetitive. To address this, I've developed several tools using Bash and Python to automate these processes, allowing me to focus on what matters most

When it comes to languages, I believe English is a fundamental skill in this field. That’s why I earned my Cambridge B2 certificate this year, and I plan to prepare for the C1 next year
